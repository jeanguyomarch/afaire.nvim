Please see the README, waiting for a better introduction...

afaire.setup({opts})                                            *afaire.setup()*
  Setup function to be called by the user prior using the plugin.

  Usage:
  >
  require("afaire").setup({
    notes_directory = "~/notes",

    default_namespace = "default",
    default_filetype = "markdown",
    default_extension = ".md",

    -- Set this to `false` if you don't want to use the integration
    -- with telescope.
    with_telescope_extension = true,

    -- Override some intervals of the plugin
    template = function(...) end,
    load_metadata = function(...) end,

  })


afaire.Afaire(...)                                            *afaire.Afaire*
  
  Vim command that creates a new note (in the current namespace). The plugin
  automatically creates a new note with most parameters already setup for you.
  This includes the title of the note, which corresponds to the arguments
  provided to the command?

  If no argument is provided to the command, the title must be written
  directly in the buffer.

  Save the file to write the note.

  Please note that the note file is created with a timestamp of the current
  time (in seconds). This is not robust at all to concurrent accesses. I.e.
  if two notes are simultaneously created at the same "time" within the same
  second, there will be two handled on the same file.
